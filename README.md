# Extra-Base Hit and Strikeout frequency throughout Professional Baseball
## Joseph Notis

## Plot Description:
In baseball, offensive and defensive strategies over time. The figure shows one way these strategies changed from both an offensive and defensive viewpoint. One of the simple ways to show that change is based on the frequency of the type of hits and type of outs occurring in a game. Calculating the per game percentage of hits that were extra-base hits can reveal offensive strategies. A higher percentage often shows a more power-based strategy, while a lower percentage shows that teams aimed to play "small-ball," which focuses on less extra-base hits in favor of frequent singles, sacrifice plays, walks, and stolen bases. Strikeout percentage also can reveal offensive and defensive strategies. An increase in strikeout frequency could be a sign of various changes. More frequent strikeouts per game could be a sign of improved pitching, but it could also signify that more players are taking more chances at strikes. Highlighting different eras helps categorize the data. Additionally, pointing out specific events, such as the start and end of World War II (WWII), helps the user see how significant events can cause a major change in extra-base hit and strikeout frequencies.
